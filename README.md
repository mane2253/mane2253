FinMan Company is looking to leverage their client base by cross selling insurance products to existing customers. Insurance policies are offered to prospective and existing clients based on website landing and consumer election to fill out additional information forms. FinMan company would like to leverage their acquired information to classify positive leads for outreach programs using machine learning classifiers.When these customers fill-up the form, their Response towards the policy is considered positive and they are classified as a lead. Once these leads are acquired, the sales advisors approach them to convert and thus the company can sell proposed health insurance to these leads in a more efficient manner.Data includes demographic features, policy features (for current customers) and example positive classifications for ML model validation and interpretation. The source can be found here. The project analysis will follow the OSEMN framework: Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model and Interpret.
